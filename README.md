# "A Few in a Row" Project Proposal

### Target Market
The product’s target market are people who need to take a short break from working at the office and enjoy some friendly competition with a quick game of Tic-tac-toe. The game can be enjoyed by anyone of any age.

### Problem being Solved
Our product solves the problem of having nothing fun to do while on break, and as we know breaks are important for productivity, thus a Tic-tac-toe break is a healthy distraction. The problem with traditional Tic-tac-toe is its too simple.  The game has already been mastered, and a game by two people with experience will always end in a tie.  We plan to create the same game everybody knows with a twist to make it more fun and exciting.  "A Few in a Row" will provide people who love Tic-tac-toe with a fun leisure time activity.

### The Product
The product is in the category of games and as such serves the purpose of entertainment. The popular name of the game is “Tic-tac-toe”; however, we plan on calling it “A Few in a Row” in order to portray the added functionality and game modes that will be included.

### Main Advantages
That leads to the advantages of "A Few in a Row" which are: 
* Ability to play locally on one or two computers with friends or coworkers.  
* Having a computer player to play against for when another player isn’t available to play against.  
* A unique twist on the traditional game.  Having an expanded 20x20 grid in which players try to get 5 elements in a line to win.

### Main Differences
Classic Tic-tac-toe has been played on paper, and there's even online versions of it. There are some disadvantages to the classic method of playing that our game hopes to remedy.  Our game will: 
* Not require paper or a reliable internet connection as the game is played locally.  
* Solve the problem of not having another person to play with.  
* Solve the problem of simplistic and boring gameplay.
### Product Offering
To put it all together, "A Few in a Row" is going to be a better version of the conventional Tic-tac-toe, offering: 
* A 20x20 grid with the aim to get 5 in a row
* With multiplayer (PvP) capabilities either on:
  * The same computer as a friend or
  * Seperate computers on the same network
* A clever artificial intelligence (AI) to challenge players to try and beat the computer when there is no one around to play with.  

All of that comes packaged in a beautifully designed user interface that is both practical and aesthetically pleasing.
